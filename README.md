My Seminars
===========

An assortment of talks and seminars I made, this collects slides notes and some
pictures.  All notes and slides are mine, some of the images used are not mine
and therefore are properly referenced in the surrounding text.

If, by mistake, I forgot to add proper credit for an image do not be afraid
from poking me about it.
