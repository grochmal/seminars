\section{Introduction to (some) cryptography}

\subsection{Why is it useful?}
\begin{frame}{Why is it useful?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Keeping your privacy is hard today.
    \item We will talk about a way of keeping your private messages private.
    \item Email is very easy to spoof, it goes in clear text over the internet.
    \item Moreover, email is trivial to interfere with.
    \item If I control the email server you send your email through I can
change your messages as I want.
    \item Even if I do not have access to that server I can still send email
impersonating you.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Cryptography}
\begin{frame}{Cryptography kindergarten}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cryptography has always been used to achieve \emph{confidentiality},
yet before the 20th century the algorithm of encrypting/decrypting the message
was the secret being kept.
    \item This is not viable in the world with instantaneous communication.
    \item Today cryptographic algorithms are open and are injected with a piece
of information (the \emph{key}) that shall be kept secret to recover the
message.
    \item The format of the \emph{key} depends on the algorithm used.
    \item Yet there is much more to cryptography than the encryption
algorithms.  Algorithms alone are very poor at keeping information secret.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cryptographic terms}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Plaintext (or cleartext)] \hfill \\
is the message before any encryption.
    \item[Cyphertext] \hfill \\
is the message after encryption, it shall not be possible to recover the
\emph{plaintext} from the \emph{cyphertext} without the right \emph{key}.
    \item[Context] \hfill \\
The typical context of cryptography is that we have two parties that wish to
communicate through an insecure media.  Both parties need to perform certain
steps and then use a cypher to communicate securely through this media.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cryptographic terms}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Cypher] \hfill \\
is the encryption algorithm used.
    \item[Encryption scheme] \hfill \\
normally refers to a cypher and an algorithm that dictates how the plaintext
and cyphertext shall be cared about.  Just using a cypher does not ensures that
you communicate securely.
    \item[Security] \hfill \\
The word \textbf{security} is overloaded in cryptography, and in society in
general.  We will only describe \emph{secure communication} as communication
adhering to some guarantees.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types of cyphers}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Symmetric Cypher] \hfill \\
is used by two parties with access to the same \emph{key}.
    \item[Asymmetric Cypher] \hfill \\
In an \emph{asymmetric cypher} each of the parties hold \emph{two keys}, one
\emph{public key} that is shared with the other party and one \emph{private
key} which is kept secret.
    \item[Hybrid Cypher] \hfill \\
is a use of both symmetric and asymmetric cyphers.  An asymmetric cypher is
used to encrypt a generated key, this key is then used to encrypt the message
using a symmetric cypher.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types of cyphers}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Digital signature] \hfill \\
is a cypher that is \emph{not} used to encrypt a plaintext into a scrambled
form.  Instead a digital signature is used to ensure that a piece of
information was not tampered with.
    \item[Cryptographic hash] \hfill \\
A \emph{cryptographic hash} is a one way function, i.e. given the output of the
function it is nearly impossible to determine its input.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Typical characters of the cryptographic world}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Alice] wishes to communicate with Bob.
    \item[Bob] wishes to communicate with Alice.
    \item[Charlie] (or Carol) a third person that might wish to communicate.
    \item[Eve] tries to eavesdrop communication between Alice and Bob.  Eve has
only the resources of a casual eavesdropper.
\href{https://xkcd.com/177/}{Eve on xkcd}.
    \item[Mallory] an individual of malicious intent.  Mallory is often assumed
to have almost infinite resources to tamper with the communication between
Alice and Bob.
    \item[Trent] a trusted friend of Alice and Bob.  Alice and Bob can exchange
information through Trent.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Symmetric and Asymmetric Schemes}
\begin{frame}{Symmetric schemes}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Alice and Bob share a \emph{key}.
    \item When Alice wants to send a message to Bob she encrypts it with this
\emph{key}, Bob then decrypts the message with the same \emph{key}.  And
vice-versa.
    \item The \emph{key} must be shared by some other media.
    \item It starts to become problematic when Charlie wishes to communicate:
now Alice must agree on a different \emph{key} with Charlie, Bob as well need
to agree on an even different \emph{key} with Charlie.  The number of keys that
need to be kept secret grows with the number of participants (\emph{n})
according to \texttt{n(n+1)/2}.  Which is quite a lot if you want to
communicate with dozens of people.
    \item This could be facilitated if Trent would hold everyone's keys and all
communication would go through him.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Asymmetric schemes}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Thankfully people came upon the idea of asymmetric cryptography.
    \item Asymmetric cryptography uses asymmetric cyphers and digital
signatures to do its work.  (note the difference between "asymmetric
cryptography" and "asymmetric cypher" here.)
    \item Alice has two keys one \emph{private} and one \emph{public}, Bob as
well has two keys.
    \item Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.
    \item When Alice wishes to encrypt a message to Bob she uses Bob's public
key to encrypt it, the resulting cyphertext can only be decrypted by Bob.
    \item Alice can also sign a message with her private key.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Guarantees that asymmetric cryptography tries to provide}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Confidentiality] \hfill \\
provided by encryption itself (by a hybrid cypher).
    \item[Integrity] \hfill \\
provided by digital signatures.
    \item[Authenticity and/or Nonrepudiation] \hfill \\
provided by digital signatures.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Confidentiality}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Ensures that without the right key the message is unreadable.
    \item i.e. the plaintext cannot be easily guessed from the cyphertext.
    \item This is normally what comes to mind when thinking about cryptography.
Mostly because it is \emph{encryption} of the message that provides
confidentiality.
    \item Note that confidentiality by itself do not prevent a third party from
tampering with the message.
    \item Even worse, confidentiality do not ensures that the sender of the
message is the individual you think it is.  In the asymmetric encryption scheme
anyone can encrypt a message to you allowing for confidentiality, yet he can
still impersonate someone else as being the sender of the message.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Integrity}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Ensures that the message has not been tampered with.
    \item Or better, ensures that if the message was tampered with it is alway
possible to recognise that it was tampered.
    \item Integrity is ensured by \emph{digital signatures}.
    \item Tampering with email is easy, tampering with other forms of
communication through the internet or through an intranet is not overly
complicated either.
    \item A digital signature is different for every message as it is generated
from a hash of the message and the private key of the sender.
    \item Note that even a correctly encrypted message may have been tampered
with.  Mallory can hijack the original message and send his own message instead
of the original one.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Authenticity and/or Nonrepudiation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Ensures that the message came from the person you believe it came
from.
    \item This is different from integrity in the fact that the sender might
have never sent a message to you.
    \item Authenticity is ensured by \emph{digital signatures}.
    \item When Alice signs a message and sends it to Bob, Bob can verify
Alice's signature and be certain that it came from Alice.
    \item If Mallory tries to impersonate Alice he would need to fake her
signature to pass as her to Bob.  Fortunately Alice keeps her private key
secret and therefore Mallory cannot forge her signature.
    \item On the other hand when Alice signs a message she cannot argue that it
wasn't her who sent it.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Exchange}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We talked a lot about Alice and Bob encrypting and signing messages.
Yet, we did not talk about how they actually exchanged their keys.
    \item Contrary to symmetric cryptography the public key do not need to be
kept secret but the key exchange is still a weak point of the asymmetric
scheme.
    \item Mallory can monitor the key exchange, hijack both public keys during
the exchange and send his own public key to both Bob and Alice.
    \item Both, Alice and Bob, must ensure that the public keys they have
belongs to each other.  One way to do it is to cross check the key fingerprint,
a hash function applied to the key.
    \item This need to be done in person, otherwise Mallory can forge the
fingerprint as well.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{History of PGP, OpenPGP and GnuPG}
\begin{frame}{History of OpenPGP}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Phil Zimmermann created the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) program.
    \item It was distributed as a book because of US law on exporting
encryption.
    \item PGP had issues with patents as it used IDEA and RSA algorithms.
    \item In 1997 Zimmermann proposed the openPGP standard to IETF.
    \item By 1999 Werner Koch released the Free Software implementation of the
openPGP standard, the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG).
    \item Zimmermann continues to maintain several versions of PGP software, as
a commercial product.  Trading as PGP Inc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{GnuPG and OpenPGP}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item OpenPGP is the standard, GnuPG is the \emph{implementation}.
    \item Main standard is
\href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880}{RFC4880} (previously
\href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2440}{RFC2440},
\href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1991}{RFC1991})
    \item Some standardised extensions are used in GnuPG: the camelia cypher
from \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5581}{RFC5581}, and the use of MIME
email extension as in \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3156}{RFC3156}.
    \item GnuPG is probably the most widely used implementation: it is used by
software packagers to sign the packages of their distributions, by developers
to sign releases of their software and is promoted by the
\href{http://www.fsf.org/}{FSF} and the \href{http://www.eff.org}{EFF} as
\emph{the} software for email encryption.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Practice}

\subsection{Generate a key}
\begin{frame}{A simple walkthrough example}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item GnuPG has a plethora of options which we could discuss for hours,
instead we have the time to go through a very rough example of setting it up.
    \item Learning all options in GnuPG is not very useful as a starting point,
you need to use it a couple of times to understand what are the things you can
do and why are there certain things that GnuPG will not allow you.
    \item One of the most painful parts for a beginner in the GnuPG interface
is understanding when you are using the private and when you are using the
public key.  Caches in new versions of GnuPG do not help the confusion.
    \item The talks on email encryption are divided in three parts so you have
a chance to acquaint yourself with GnuPG at one level before going forward.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Key Generation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item With \verb|gpg --gen-key|
    \item It'll ask for a key type, use "RSA and RSA".
    \item For a key length, 2048 bits shall be enough for today's needs.
    \item For a \emph{UID} which is constructed as:
    \item[] \texttt{Real name (comment) <email>}.
    \item And for a passphrase to protect your key.  The private key is never
stored on disk in plain format, it is always encrypted with a key derived from
your passphrase.
    \item Choose a good passphrase.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Export and Import keys}
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Export the public key}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Find your key with \verb|gpg -k|
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Revocation and Key Exchange}
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Generate a revocation certificate}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The revocation certificate will be needed if you lose access to your
key.  Therefore keep it safe, even safer than the key.
    \item Generate the certificate with
    \item[] \verb|gpg -a --gen-revoke B713DB95|
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)
Comment: A revocation certificate should follow

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----
\end{verbatim}
}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Keep your keys safe}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item With all the processes above you can use the \verb|-o| flag to
redirect the interesting output directly to a file, e.g.
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
gpg -a -o mypublickey.asc --export B713DB95
gpg -a -o mysecretkey.asc --export-secret-keys B713DB95
gpg -a -o mykeyrevoke.asc --gen-revoke B713DB95
\end{verbatim}
}
    \item Now you need to publish your public key and other people can send you
encrypted emails.
    \item The person to whom you will send your key must import it into GnuPG,
therefore we will look at how to do that.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Import Mike's key}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item My public key can be found
\href{http://grochmal.org/static/grochmal.asc}{here}, let's save and import it
with:
    \item[] \verb|gpg --import grochmal.asc|
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
[mike@orion ~]$ wget http://grochmal.org/static/grochmal.asc
[mike@orion ~]$ gpg --import grochmal.asc
gpg: key C840C4F6: public key "Michal Grochmal (hacker) <mike@grochmal.org>"
imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
\end{verbatim}
}
    \item Check if it is there using \verb|gpg -k|
    \item Note that \verb|gpg -K| does not print the imported key.  Only the
public key was imported, the private key is not part of the published key.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Sign Mike's key}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How can you be sure that that key belongs to me?
    \item Ask me in person my fingerprint, which by the way is:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
    D4BF 80AE EF39 263E B9C5  E80D 040E 2771 C840 C4F6
\end{verbatim}
}
    \item Before you use this key to send encrypted email you need to tell
GnuPG that you checked the fingerprint:
    \item[] \verb|gpg --edit-key C840C4F6| - opens the command interface
    \item[] \verb|Command> fpr| - shows the fingerprint, check it!
    \item[] \verb|Command> sign| - signs the key (you may need to enter your
private key password to use it to sign the key).
    \item[] \verb|Command> check| - shows the signatures on the key.
    \item[] \verb|Command> save| - saves the modifications to the key and
exits.
    \item An email client will warn about a non-signed key.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{"Trust"}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Another heavily overloaded word in cryptography.
    \item In GnuPG this word is even more overloaded, if you read anything
about GnuPG you will see this word a lot.
    \item When you signed my key you assured yourself that the key is Mike's
key.
    \item Trust on the other hand is a measure of how much you \emph{trust}
that Mike vehemently checks all keys he signs.
    \item e.g. your checking of keys right now is biased, how do you know I am
Mike Grochmal?  I can be lying to you from the start!
    \item Trust is very important for GnuPG, but we will leave the discussion
of it for later.
GnuPG.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Email Clients}
\begin{frame}{Email clients that support GnuPG}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Email clients recognise your GnuPG configuration and use it to send
encrypted or signed emails.  As of this writing the following email clients
support email encryption with GnuPG.
    \item \href{https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/}{thunderbird} has an
extension called \href{https://www.enigmail.net}{enigmail}.
    \item \href{http://www.claws-mail.org/}{claws-mail} has a
\href{http://www.claws-mail.org/plugin.php?plugin=gpg}{GPG plugin}.
    \item \href{http://www.mutt.org/}{mutt} supports PGP out of the box, yet
configuring mutt is not trivial.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Summary}

\subsection{Different schemes you may encounter}
\begin{frame}{Public and Private keys, different schemes}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Today the most popular encryption scheme and cypher is RSA.
    \item It uses the fact that factoring very large numbers is hard.
    \item RSA private key can be used to sign and the public key to encrypt.
    \item Yet not all encryption schemes allow for such a use of keys.
    \item For example, the DSA scheme can only be used to make signatures.
    \item Another asymmetric encryption scheme is the ElGamal scheme.
    \item At the level of GnuPG it does not matter for us which scheme we are
using.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
